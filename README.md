Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile, this is a place for me to upload a little about my journey into programming
I started coding during the lockdown of 2020 and have been enjoying it quite a bit, specially knowing that there is an
incredible amount of things to learn, courses to complete, books to read, and projects to code.
This page it's meant to be a journal about these books courses and projects but first let's get to know each other
a bit more, don't worry, I'll start.

## Something about myself

I was born in 1997 in Bogotá, Colombia and I started coding on 2020 due to an internship
opportunity in the field of software programming, I started studying in for a year and went throughout that internship during the best part of six months
and learned a lot about SQL databases and PHP development and worked on myself to learn about algorithms, data structures and python.

I enjoy coding a lot because it's problem-solving I have gotten stuck in many little problems and I see my code when I started and see many things that I thought we're clever and the right way to do it, and I was completely wrong, but I enjoy the grind, having to stop and learn new things, going back and checking
what is wrong and even more seeing the final product, seeing the result of all that hard work, being able to fix that bug and having that feature I thought would
be cool working to me makes it all worth it.

## Some of what I have learned and where I have 

### Books that I have read

- Python 3 the hard way
- Grokking's algorithms
- The joy of PHP

### Books that I am still reading

- Clean Code
- Clean architecture
- Introduction to algorithms 
- The pragmatic programmer
- Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming
- Hal Leonard guitar method

### Courses I made

- I made some courses for PHP and OOP development on LinkedIn learning
- And many courses on YouTube, specially trough FreeCodeCamp.org

### Projects I have been working in

- Some of these are in the repositories in this GitHub, specially in the projects one 

## What's happening right now

Well right now if I'm honest I am looking for a job I want to learn a lot more about programming since I know what I know it's not even a drop
of water in the vast ocean of coding and programming, I want to keep learning and being able to help others with what I code I'm looking for that
chance to learn and put to good use and practice all that I have, am, and will learn.
